# Palette
Palette is a [Concatenative Synthesizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenative_synthesis#In_music) in the making. 
I originally sat down to write a similar instrument called Nave. There are quite a few reasons for this rewrite which I do plan to enumerate
in a blog post. This project takes a lot of inspiration from CataRT. I was introduced to the Max program and instantly loved the concept, though
I believe there's a lot of room for improvement and a lot which could be gained by writing the software from scratch in C++.

# Building
Thanks to the FRUT project, build files can be generated with cmake.
To generate build files, run `mkdir build && cd build` then run `cmake .. `
